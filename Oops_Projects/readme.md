LMS.py
is an ðŸ“˜ Python OOP Assignment â€“ Build a Library Management System
ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
In this assignment, you will apply the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python to create a basic Library Management System.

The purpose of this exercise is to help you understand how real-world entities can be modeled using classes and objects. You will create two classes â€” one for individual books, and another for the overall library that manages those books.

This assignment will specifically test your understanding of:

Creating classes in Python
Using the __init__() constructor to initialize objects
Proper use of the self keyword
Writing and using instance methods
ðŸŽ¯ Objective
You need to design two classes:

1. Book class â€“ represents a single book.
2. Library class â€“ represents a collection of books and provides functionality to manage them.
Each class must be thoughtfully designed, and the interaction between them should reflect how a real library works.



gamer.py 
is an ðŸŽ® Gamer & Game Platform â€“ OOP Python Assignment
ðŸ“˜ Objective
Design a simple gaming platform using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. This assignment will help you strengthen your understanding of:

__init__, self
Writing and calling methods
Using assert statements for validation
Adding type hints
Object interactions (using one class inside another)
Scenario
You are building a backend for a basic gaming platform called PlayZone. On this platform:

Users (called Gamers) can join various online games.
Each game has a minimum level requirement.
A gamer can only join a game if they meet the required level.
You, as the developer, have to create two classes â€” Gamer and Game â€” and define how they interact.
